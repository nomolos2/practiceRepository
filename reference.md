# Reference resources

This began as an [issue](https://github.com/nomolos2/practiceRepository/issues/2) about the HTML topics you guys should learn, 
but then it seemed like, with links to documentation and stuff, it could be a valuable reference to you and to the rest of your
class.

## Basic mechanics for your project

 - Git: [This tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/) looks ok. 
   [Here's](https://www.google.com/search?q=vim+basic+introduction&oq=vi&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i61j69i60l3.684j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) a 
   Google search I used to find some. Maybe some of the videos are good.
 - GitHub: [Here's](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) an intro.
 - [Vim](https://www.linux.com/tutorials/vim-101-beginners-guide-vim/): You'll be doing mnost of your code
   editing in VSCode, but when you commit changes in Git, it's going to bring up an editor. Nomolos2 has his
   set to nano, which is a lot easier to use than vi or vim, but it's really a terrible editor. Vim is great
   if you know how to use it. The link here is a basic introduction.
 - VSCode: Except for @lizamarri, you all have VSCode installed, so you can ignore the installation stuff, but
   [here's](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) a basic intro. For chromebook, lizamarri has
   `Text`, but if that doesn't seem great, you can look for [other text editors](https://www.maketecheasier.com/best-text-editor-for-chromebook/). 

## HTML

- [basic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) syntax and [elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
 - formatting elements (MDN calls [text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Text_content) and [sectioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Content_sectioning))
   - h1, h2, ...
   - p, div, span
     - block vs. inline elements
 - more HTML syntax
   - attributes
   - ids
   - classes
   - brief intro to CSS
 - [image and multimedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Image_and_multimedia)
 - [form elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#) -- [guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms)
   - input
     - type=text, radio, checkbox
   - select, option
   - etc.
 - the DOM
   - through right-click-->inspect
   - through $_  in the developer console
   - tie DOM elements to JavaScript
  
## Markdown

Markdown is useful in lots of applications. [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is used in GitHubs README.md (and any other `md`) pages
and in issues. If you want to include formatting, links, lists, etc. in your issues or README pages, you need markdown.
